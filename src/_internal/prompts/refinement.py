"""Wordlists for the AI-phrase scrubber.

Two exports consumed by ``src/adapters.py::remove_ai_phrases_text``:

- ``AI_PHRASE_BLACKLIST`` — phrases that signal LLM-generated prose.
- ``AI_PHRASE_REPLACEMENTS`` — keyed by the lowercased blacklist entry;
  value is the substitution (empty string deletes the phrase).

These lists are derived from Resume Matcher (Apache-2.0,
https://github.com/srbhr/Resume-Matcher) at the snapshot point of the
original fork. See ``NOTICES`` at the repo root for attribution.

Local modification: the upstream maps ``--`` and ``---`` to ``, `` to
treat them as em-dash substitutes. In LaTeX source (this tool's output
format) ``--`` is the en-dash glyph and appears in legitimate date
ranges like ``Jul 2024 -- Present``. Both have been removed from the
blacklist to keep those typographic conventions intact. The Unicode
em-dash ``—`` is still scrubbed.
